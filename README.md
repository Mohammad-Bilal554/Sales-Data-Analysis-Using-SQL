## Insights from Analysis
- Certain categories have higher average discounts than others.  
- Top products by discount can be identified quickly using ORDER BY and LIMIT.  
- Categories with higher average ratings and total reviews can inform marketing strategies.  
- Views provide a summarized snapshot for reporting purposes.  
- Self-joins and conditional queries help compare products within the same category.
